/*
Question-
https://leetcode.com/problems/find-in-mountain-array/

Intuition-
1. We will use binary search to solve this problem.
2. First, we will find the index of the peak element. Then we will search in the strictly increasing part of the array.
3. If the target is not present in the strictly increasing part, then we will search in the strictly decreasing part of the array.

Complexities-
TC: O(logN)
SC: O(1)
